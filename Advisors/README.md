This folder houses custom indicators developed for specific trading strategies. These indicators play a crucial role in the analysis and execution of our trading approaches. Only a few strategies use them.

### **Old Ideas**

Here you'll find a collection of systems that are considered outdated and have been discarded. While they may be revisited in the future, they are currently on standby due to diverse reasons. 

### **Ready to Opt**

Strategies within this folder are ready for optimization using the parameter optimization feature from MetaTrader. Successful strategies may be moved to the 'Released' folder.
