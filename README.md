# MQL5-Bots (Deprecated)

This is a collection of bots, indicators and scripts in order to test and to get familiarized with the MQL5 language and MT5 usage.     

While this public repository will remain accessible, I have also initiated the development of a private repository where I will continue refining and advancing the strategies for commercial use.     
   
The expert advisors and tools presented here can still serve as valuable resources for those seeking inspiration and initial ideas for their trading systems. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to gain insights into MQL5 language and MT5 usage.    

## Install (Windows)

It creates an isolated environment including all the resources inside the repository folder, therefore not following the MT5 default folder structure.    

Clone into the `Experts` folder:     

`C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\{CODE}\MQL5\Experts`    

If you want to commit or push from the given path, it is likely that an additional command will be required:    

`git config --global --add safe.directory C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\{CODE}\MQL5\Experts\MQL5-Bots`    


## Utils

### Backtest

#### Backtest results
After every backtest, a .csv with the details of the trades will be stored in this path:

`C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Tester\{CODE}\Agent-127.0.0.1-3000\MQL5\Files`    

The filename is not relevant, sort it by date to get the latest.
